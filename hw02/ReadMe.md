1. The Buttons_to_LEDs.py lets you control 4 leds via 4 buttons
2. The Etch_matt_howlett.py is my adapted etch-a-sketch that lets the user control motion, clear and quit via gpios tied to buttons
3. The gpiotoggle.py allows for pin toggle testing using python. Follow onscreen prompts to set pin as in PX_X and time in seconds
4. The pintoggle program biult from the c and h files present allows for pin toggle testing using c. First parameter is the gpio parameter and second is duration of ontime in us. GPIO number example: for P8_10 the parameter would be 68 corresponding to GPIO_68.
