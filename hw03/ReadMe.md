Hi Dr. Yoder,

All i2c devices are on i2c bus 2. the rotary encoders are on P8_33, P8_35, P8_41, P8_42.
1. I got the temp sensors to work and I wrote a shell script to interface with them and
 report the temperature in degrees F.

2. The dot matrix works with my etch a sketch program.

3. The rotary encoders works with the etch a sketch program.
 In addition. there is a  quit and clear button connected on pins P8_27,P8_28.
