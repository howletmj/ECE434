1. I've added my rfid reader project to the list
2. I have made the makefile and it is in the repo
3. I cross compiled the hello world program. A JPG of the result is shown in the repo.
4. I've updated the kernel on my bone. It took 3 hours with only 1 core.
5. I got the kernel led module to work on pin P9_15 instead of P9_23.

Looks good. 
The file 'Makefile' is empty.  

Wow, 3 hours to compile.  Try adding more cores next time.
